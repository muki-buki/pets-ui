# Welcome to this amazing pet store project

Works in nodejs engines > 6.x.x.

To get started: 
```
  npm install
  npm start
```

Then go to localhost:3000

# Testing

In order to run the unit tests: 

```
  npm test
```

# State of the modules

Since I just did a fresh `npm install` that took a bit longer I checked node_modules folder:

```
$ ls node_modules | wc -l
684
```

```
$ du -sh node_modules
198M    node_modules
```

Ouch!

# Next
Stay put! A lot of exciting features are coming (that means also more dependencies ....)
